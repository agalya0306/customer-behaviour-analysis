# customer-behaviour-analysis

The Customer Behaviour Analysis project leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data analytics to analyze and predict customer purchasing patterns, preferences, and trends. In its final phase, the system integrates predictive modeling, sentiment analysis, and real-time data processing to provide businesses with actionable insights for marketing strategies, customer retention, and sales optimization. This document presents a comprehensive report on the project’s completion, covering system demonstration, technical documentation, performance metrics, source code, and testing reports. The project is designed for scalability, real-time analytics, and seamless integration with CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems. Screenshots, data flow diagrams, and codebase snapshots are included for a complete understanding of the system’s architecture and functionality.
